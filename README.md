# Healthcare
project3(C)

In this project, I will model a (simplified) emergency room. In an emergency room waiting area with patients lining up to see a physician. Each patient has a name and a priority rating (which we will ignore for now; my emergency room operates on a first-come first-serve bases). All structures in this project are opaque, i.e, their fields are not exposed to the client anymore. As a result, the only interaction with these structures can happen through module functions, such as, create, destroy, and print.
